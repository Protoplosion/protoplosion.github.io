                <h3>1951</h3>
                <p>Recognizing a critical issue faced by scientists in need of resources and grappling with funding challenges, a visionary billionaire took initiative. As a solution, the concept of Free Access Laboratories was conceived, aiming to provide a conducive environment for scientific research and innovation.</p>
                <p>Established during the 1950s, the F.A.L. endeavors to offer financial support and dedicated facilities to individuals within the scientific community. This vital assistance serves to advance research projects during that era, with the ultimate goal of accelerating progress and to bring the future closer than ever before.</p>

                <h3>1960</h3>
                <p>Pioneer Labs began to receive funding from the government.</p>

            <div class="event">
                <h3>1975</h3>
                <p>The government promised to increase its funding if Pioneer Labs met its terms. They needed to create something revolutionary to commercialize around the world by 1985. So, Pioneer Labs decided to embark on the research of portal technology.</p>

                <h3>1979</h3>
                <p>Artifical inteligence became a talking point within Pioneer Labs A small startup was in progress and later pitched to the CEO to expand on this technology to please the investors. The CEO agreed, but with other intentions.</p>

            <div class="event">
                <h3>1982</h3>
                <p>The government increased its funding with Pioneer Labs ahead of schedule. The reason for this is unknown. In response, Pioneer Labs remained a public entity and continued to pursue the portal project just as normal along side artificial intelligence.</p>
                <p>The existing status of the portal technology became stable and, consequently, was deemed suitable for implementation beyond the confines of Pioneer Labs.</p>

                <h3>1983</h3>
                <p>The primary purpose behind the creation of the Intelligent Cores was to establish specialized archives for Pioneer Labs. Fortunately, the designers intentionally calibrated their learning capabilities correctly, resulting in the expected emergence of distinct personalities within the cores, ultimately leading to their enhanced functionality and efficiency.</p>

                <h3>1986</h3>
                <p>The Australis, originally conceived as a cargo vessel for international transport, underwent a radical transformation to serve in an ambitious endeavor involving the stable portal technology for hauling heavy loads worldwide.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="vr"></div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>1987</h3>
                <p>Prior to the pivotal experiment of the Australis, several smaller tests had been conducted to assess feasibility. Thanks to careful planning and a patient approach by the initiative's Supervisor, the main experiment proceeded smoothly, leading to a successful outcome without any incidents.</p>
                <p>After a pivotal experiment, an unforeseen and perplexing event transpired within the facility. A vessel, resembling the Australis but marred by scorch marks, materialized abruptly within the facility's confines, obliterating everything in its path. The origin of this ship remained shrouded in mystery, with all signs of life on board discovered in a state of cremation.</p>
                <p>A comprehensive inquiry into the vessel ensued, leading investigators to uncover advanced technologies akin to those of the Australis, albeit significantly damaged. Diligent efforts were made to restore these technologies, ultimately revealing that the ship shared similar intentions to the Australis.</p>

            <div class="event">
                <h3>1992</h3>
                <p>Over the following years, the charred ship remained a subject of investigation, ultimately shedding light on the identities of the original crew who had either been left behind or met their demise during the ill-fated journey. This revelation provided compelling evidence in support of the proclaimed multiverse theory, demonstrating the existence of these individuals in their universe.</p>
                <p>Following the initial anticipation of uncovering evidence related to multiverse traversal, it became increasingly evident that these technologies possessed the latent potential for such capabilities, a feature evidently not part of the original design. Intriguingly, it transpired that this entire scenario had its origins in an accident at another facility within a separate universe, where a simiar experiment involving portal technology had been hastily conducted.</p>
                <p>A dedicated research team was assembled to further explore and enhance the capabilities of multiversal travel shifting the focus with the Australis.</p>

                <h3>2002</h3>
                <p>Upon the completion of the Direct and Versatile Intelligence System (DaVIS), the team dedicated to multiversal travel attained profound expertise in comprehending the intricate workings of the multiverse.</p>
                <p>Drawing upon their newfound knowledge, they embarked on ventures to various universes where Pioneer Facilities were situated. In a spirit of cooperation, the CEO chose to extend their support and actively contribute to the advancement of research endeavors in these parallel universes.</p>

                <h3>2023</h3>
                <p>In the present era, a catastrophic event unfolded, resulting in the sudden  disruption of an entire universe, causing it to oscillate in and out of existence.</p>
                <p>This unprecedented calamity has had far-reaching consequences across the multiverse. In response to this crisis, Pioneer Labs has taken swift action to initiate recovery efforts and restore stability.</p>
