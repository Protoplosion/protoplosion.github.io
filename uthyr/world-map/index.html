                <h2>Ausmane-Ra</h2>
                <h3>Pyarkher</h3>
                <p>Capitol of Ausmane-Ra. Long story short, friends with the Pishtar Empire.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Dashashan</h2>
                <h3>Bu-Sha City</h3>
                <p>The capital of Dashashan stands as a vibrant oasis amid the vast expanse of the Dashashan Desert. Strategically situated away from the relentless sandstorms and towering dunes, Busha City serves as a bastion against external threats. Within its verdant confines dwell the Sha, a Human-like snake species. Renowned for their advanced civilization and mastery of steam power, the Sha are the descendants of snake dragons that once ruled the land. Despite their reverence for tradition, some Sha live on the outskirts as outlaws, their actions leading to their exclusion from Sha society.</p>
                <h3>Thou-Sand Desert</h3>
                <p>Stretching endlessly across Dashashan, the Thou-Sand Desert, also known simply as the Dashashan Desert, is a harsh and unforgiving landscape dominated by sprawling sandy hills and perpetual sandstorms, challenging all who dare to traverse its windswept terrain. Amidst the shifting sands and swirling dust clouds, tales of ancient ruins where hidden treasures are found, drawing adventurers and explorers from far and wide.</p>
                <h3>Draon Mountain</h3>
                <p>Nestled amidst the rugged terrain of the Dashashan Desert, Draon Mountain stands as a solitary guard against the backdrop of endless sand dunes. This formidable peak, shrouded in mystery on the ancient snake dragons, is home to a band of outlaws who eke out a precarious existence in its shadow. Cut off from the bustling city life of Busha and the safety of Sha society, these renegades live by their own rules and beliefs. Though they are Sha, their actions have led to their disavowal by the king, rendering them outcasts in their own society. Despite their plight, they remain united by a fierce sense of camaraderie, determined to carve out a place for themselves in the harsh desert landscape.</p>

                <h2>Hamarheim</h2>
                <p>This island, Hamarheim, got its name from Old Norse, meaning "Hammer Home" due to a landmass in the south that resembles a hammer shape with a curved handle. Hamarheim, situated near the North Pole, experiences longer winters with heavy snowfall compared to other regions. It is divided into five Holds, each ruled by its own Jarl, and features property boundaries marked by thin lines across the map. Its capital, Viljasterkur, has undergone numerous transformations over the years, and today, it stands as a favoured destination for traders and travellers alike.</p>
                <h3>Regions/Cities</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><i>Greywood:</i> Greywood, a city abundant in towering grey trees, is the sole settlement on an island resembling a hammer, giving Hamarheim its name. This island played a role in the Polarskish conquest of the north. They utilized a unique native wood from this island, greywood, which can effortlessly break through glaciers, making it a valuable resource. Additionally, greywood serves as the primary material for crafting various weapons and tools.</p></li>
                    <li><p><i>Jarnnog Islands:</i> The name for the group of islands around Hamarheim.</p></li>
                    <li><p><i>Joklaborg:</i> The city known for its hold on most Jarnnog Islands.</p></li>
                    <li><p><i>Midfjord:</i> The centre-most city in Hamarheim.</p></li>
                    <li><p><i>Nadirstar:</i> A serene town where numerous Hamrish elders choose to study or spend their remaining days.</p></li>
                    <li><p><i>Vesturhald:</i> The west-most city in Hamarheim.</p></li>
                    <li><p><i>Viljasterkur:</i> This is one of Hamarheim's several capitals. Despite its history of frequent changes, this capital has stood the test of time and is favoured by traders. While the name suggests a Nordic influence, the people here have stronger similarities to Scots.</p></li>

                <h2>The Grozav Empire</h2>
                <h3>Grozic City</h3>
                <p>The capital of the Grozav Empire, often regarded as the continent's capital, is the world's largest city characterized by towering structures and a diverse cultural hub. The Grozav Empire holds sway over nearly every country, except for The Pishtar Empire and Dashashan, effectively splitting the continent into two empires.</p>
                <h3>Summerset Isle</h3>
                <p>When Grozav residents discovered this island, they encountered native inhabitants. The Grozic people treated the natives with kindness, and the feeling was mutual. Although the natives don't consider themselves part of Grozav, they have no objection if maps depict them as such.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Medvadia</h2>
                <h3>Medverod</h3>
                <p>The capitol of Medvadia. On visiting, it is clear that bears play a significant role in their culture. As for the country, a formidable nation, broke away from Polarskin when the Grozav Empire seized control in the past.</p>
                <h3>Zamoroshenayavezda</h3>
                <p>This is the world's tallest mountain, inhabited by giant bears renowned for their ability to scale steep snowy slopes. Researchers consider them the most formidable creatures ever created. Legend has it that the simultaneous roars of these bears shaped the mountain as their home. Its immense height makes it a notable landmark used for navigation.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>The Pishtar Empire</h2>
                <h3>Pishtar City</h3>
                <p>Didn't type LORE yet.</p>
                <h3>Tokaprushi</h3>
                <p>This is a state of the Pishtar Empire. It was once a state of The Grozav Empire but was handed over as a peace treaty and in return the Grozav Empire gets Rowenina.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Polarskin</h2>
                <h3>Gramshur</h3>
                <p>This is one of the oldest capitals in Polarskin and human history, yet no records exist from its early days, possibly due to a lack of documentation or the ravages of time and climate. Polarskin was once a vast nation spanning the entire northern half of the continent, but it fragmented when the Grozav Empire easily seized control. The current Polarskin is not the same as the ancient nation; it only retains the name.</p>
                <h3>Northstag Island</h3>
                <p>This island offers the nearest accessible point to Greater Polarskin without immediate freezing. While some may consider it part of the Great North, its habitability suggests otherwise. Hamrish monks visit here to pray, believing that proximity to higher altitudes brings them closer to the Gods.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Greater Polarskin</h2>
                <h3>Snyobego</h3>
                <p>Due to its harsh climate, Snyobego stands as the sole surviving settlement in Greater Polarskin (formerly known as the Great North). Despite its name similarity to Polarskin, it is not inhabited by Polarskish people. In the distant past, the Polarskish were known for conquering the entire northern region of the continent. Residents living to the south of Polarskin referred to everything north of them as Polarskin. When settlers from the south reached the Great North, they assumed it was already claimed by the Polarskish, hence the name. Although this was never the case, and the truth has been known for a long time, the name has persisted for simplicity. While the Polarskish occasionally visit Snyobego, it is not owned by anyone.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Rowenina</h2>
                <h3>Rowedom</h3>
                <p>Rowenina's capital boasts a vibrant culture and a history of dependence on other countries, including its past affiliation with Medvadia and the Grozav Empire. Notably, Rowenina is the sole landlocked nation and relies on the river passing through Medvadia for transporting goods, fostering a strong bond between the two countries. Additionally, Rowenina has close ties to the Grozav Empire, stemming from its trade relationship with the Pishtar Empire, which previously denied Rowenina access to the river through Medvadia.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Skuegrad</h2>
                <h3>Oaklasauw</h3>
                <p>This is Skuegrad's capital on the coast of Ganavatn Bay, long home to the Skuic people for generations. Skuegrad was formerly under Polarskin's rule but gained independence. The Grozav Empire granted Skuegrad sovereignty after invading Polarskin. Despite Skuegrad's prior independence from Polarskin, the Grozav Empire secured full independence in exchange for preferential trade and enforced religious beliefs. Despite their perceived differences in dependence, Skuegrad shares a common history with its neighbouring country, Rowenina.</p>
