                <h2>Scope</h2>
                <p>My ultimate goal is to eventually bring this world to life in video games. I'm passionate about game development, which allows me to combine my interests in programming, sound design, 3D modeling, music, and writing. While I work solo, which is often the nature of hobbies, I'd be open to connecting with like-minded individuals who share my interests and welcome their assistance, even if it's brainstorming ideas or receiving feedback from those experienced. Anything would be greatly appreciated.</p>
                <p>This world's origin differs from our own, which was created by the Big Bang. Here, it emerged from a dispute between two forces: the force of creation, sometimes called the force of chaos due to its boundless creativity leading to disorder, and the forces of balance, responsible for maintaining order. However, certain elements disrupt this balance, like the emergence of magic. These forces aren't gods; they operate with a purpose, devoid of conscious thought. While there's one force of creation, there are several forces of balance, encompassing aspects like time, space, and the laws of physics and nature, working together to maintain equilibrium.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Theme</h2>
                <p>First and foremost, it's a fantasy world. Magic in this realm is a challenging element, defying natural balance. Only a select few can master it, either through deep understanding and practice or sheer luck.</p>
                <p>Text here should generally be approached as if it were written by an adventurer from within this world, sharing their own experiences and insights. It might be the perspective of a single adventurer or possibly a cartographer who specializes in mapmaking and contributed the maps featured here.</p>
                <p>The tone can be both pleasant and difficult, depending on one's perspective and circumstances. On one hand, the breathtaking natural beauty of the land can be awe-inspiring, and the sense of adventure and exploration is ever-present. However, it's also a land filled with dangers, including roaming monsters, outlaws, and ongoing conflicts between factions.</p>
                <p>Character actions can significantly influence the world, whether by leading a victorious war or uncovering its deepest secrets.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Scene</h2>
                <h3>The Planet</h3>
                <p>Uther has similar natural laws to Earth, but the planet is smaller, approximately the size of Mars, resulting in slightly lighter gravity. This adjustment could justify higher jumps in a video game adaptation.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Cosmology</h3>
                <p>This world was created from a clash between two opposing forces: the force of creation, also known as the force of chaos for its boundless creativity leading to disorder, and the forces of balance, tasked with upholding order. The balance has created this world, where there is a reason and origin to all things that exist, holding all the connections explaining why these things exist.</p>
                <p>From a distance, this world appears similar to Earth. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that it exists within a confined realm. This unique setup was intentionally created by the forces of balance, as mentioned before, to establish equilibrium where no chaos is present. Imagine it as if the force of creation were an infinite pile of Lego, and the force of balance designated a specific area within it to build its own things. The celestial bodies you observe in the world, such as stars and galaxies, represent the Lego pile surrounding this designated play area.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Setting</h3>
                <p>The world's scale is evident in the maps. All described events occur mainly in what's shown, and while other continents may be mentioned, they won't play a crucial role. I prefer to keep them hidden, allowing for the option to introduce new elements with mysterious origins, similar to the Redguard in The Elder Scrolls, who hail from another sunken continant only described through in-game text.</p>
