                        <h2>Scope</h2>
                        <h3>Goal</h3>
                        <p>My ultimate goal is to eventually bring this world to life in video games. I'm passionate about game development, which allows me to combine my interests in programming, sound design, 3D modeling, music, and writing. While I work solo, which is often the nature of hobbies, I'd be open to connecting with like-minded individuals who share my interests and welcome their assistance, even if it's brainstorming ideas or receiving feedback from those experienced. Anything would be greatly appreciated.</p>
                        <div class="br"></div>
                        <h3>The Hook</h3>
                        <p>In a chaotic void, known as the Cadovitho, where time and space hold no sway, a pocket of equilibrium emerges, crafted by the forces of balance. This realm stands as the singular origin of all existence, yet it faces relentless threats from the ever-expanding chaos attempting to devour it. The introduction of magic, for instance, signifies a flaw beyond the forces of balance's control. In other words, a glitch in the matrix. To address this, the forces created the Knowledge Clavis'.</p>
                        <p>Each Clavis represents a concentrated reservoir of knowledge and experience in a specific field, offering individuals profound insights and abilities when briefly touched. These essences hold the key to unlocking extraordinary powers, but their one-time use and the potential for overwhelming knowledge make each encounter with an Knowledge Clavis a momentous and risky endeavor, but their existence is what holds this delicate world together. (i.e., Knowledge is the enemy of the unknown.)</p>
                        <p>Consider the Flame Clavis, a one-time-use artifact. Upon touching it, you unlock the essence of fire mastery, witnessing the dance of flames through centuries of knowledge in a split second. Imagine harnessing this knowledge to conjure firestorms or sculpt intricate fire sculptures. However, the Clavis disappears afterward, and acquiring another Flame Clavis is the only way to regain such fiery expertise. Yet, collecting too many keys risks an overwhelming influx of knowledge, akin to holding the entirety of an ancient library within your mind.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h2>Theme</h2>
                        <h3>First and Foremost</h3>
                        <p>It's a fantasy world. Magic in this realm is a challenging element, defying natural balance. Only a select few can master it, either through deep understanding and practice or sheer luck.</p>
                        <p>Text outside this meta should generally be approached as if it were written by an adventurer from within this world, sharing their own experiences and insights. It might be the perspective of a single adventurer or possibly a cartographer who specializes in mapmaking and contributed the maps featured <a href="world-map/">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>The tone can be both pleasant and difficult, depending on one's perspective and circumstances. On one hand, the breathtaking natural beauty of the land can be awe-inspiring, and the sense of adventure and exploration is ever-present. However, it's also a land filled with dangers, including roaming monsters, outlaws, and ongoing conflicts between factions.</p>
                        <div class="br"></div>
                        <h3>Recurring Themes</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><i>Ancient Mysteries:</i> The mention of ancient artifacts and cosmic chronicles suggests a theme of untold histories and mysteries. This theme contributes to a sense of depth, enriching the world with layers of undiscovered lore.</p></li>
                            <li><p><i>Cosmic Conflict:</i> The ongoing battle against chaos, influenced by the forces of creation and balance, introduces a cosmic conflict theme. This conflict enhances the tone by creating a grand-scale struggle that shapes the world's destiny.</p></li>
                            <li><p><i>Personal Struggles Amid Cosmic Conflict:</i> The cosmic conflict between creation and chaos indirectly influences the personal struggles of individuals. This theme explores how ordinary people grapple with the consequences of this grand-scale battle in their everyday lives.</p></li>
                            <li><p><i>Religious Syncretism:</i> As different communities interact and share their beliefs, a theme of religious syncretism emerges. This reflects the blending and merging of various religious practices and beliefs, creating a diverse and interconnected cultural tapestry.</p></li>
                            <li><p><i>Magic Taboo:</i> Since magic comes from the Cadovitho, a creation of the Essence of Genesis, is widely regarded as taboo or demonic. Practiced exclusively by the magic-sensitive, evil witches and individuals who use it for purposes like healing warriors, keeping their abilities hidden to avoid societal condemnation.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By incorporating these themes, Uther becomes not only a world shaped by cosmic forces but also a tapestry of diverse cultures, beliefs, and personal narratives, creating a rich and immersive fantasy setting.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h2>Scene</h2>
                        <h3>The Planet</h3>
                        <p>Uther has similar natural laws to Earth, but the planet is smaller, approximately the size of Mars, resulting in slightly lighter gravity. This adjustment could justify higher jumps in a video game adaptation.</p>
                        <div class="br"></div>
                        <h3>Cosmology</h3>
                        <p>This world's origin differs from our own, which was created by the Big Bang. Here, it emerged from a dispute between two forces: the Essence of Genesis, the force of creation, sometimes called the Force of Chaos due to its boundless creativity leading to disorder, and the Guardians of Harmony, the forces of balance, responsible for maintaining order. However, certain elements disrupt this balance, like the emergence of magic. These forces aren't gods; they operate with a purpose, devoid of conscious thought. While there's one force of creation, there are several forces of balance, encompassing aspects like time, space, and the laws of physics and nature, working together to maintain equilibrium.</p>
                        <p>From a distance, this world appears similar to Earth. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that it exists within a confined realm within a void. This realm was created by the Guardians, as mentioned before, to establish equilibrium within the infinite chaos. Imagine it as if Cadovitho were an infinite pile of Lego, and the Guardians of Harmony designated a specific area within it to build its own things. The celestial bodies you observe in the world, such as stars and galaxies, represent the Lego pile surrounding this designated play area.</p>
                        <div class="br"></div>
                        <h3>Setting</h3>
                        <p>The world's scale is evident in the maps. All described events occur mainly in what's shown, and while other continents may be mentioned, they won't play a crucial role. I prefer to keep them hidden, allowing for the option to introduce new elements with mysterious origins, similar to the Redguard in The Elder Scrolls, who hail from another sunken continant only described through in-game text.</p>
