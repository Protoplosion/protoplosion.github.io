                <h3>1951</h3>
                <p>Recognizing a critical issue faced by scientists in need of resources and grappling with funding challenges, a visionary billionaire took initiative. As a solution, the concept of Free Access Laboratories was conceived, aiming to provide a conducive environment for scientific research and innovation.</p>
                <p>Established during the 1950s, the F.A.L. endeavors to offer financial support and dedicated facilities to individuals within the scientific community. This vital assistance serves to advance research projects during that era, with the ultimate goal of accelerating progress and to bring the future closer than ever before.</p>

                <h3>1960</h3>
                <p>The Facility began to receive funding from the government.</p>

                <h3>1975</h3>
                <p>The government threatened to cut its funding if The Facility did not meet its terms. They needed to create something revolutionary to commercialize around the world by 1985. So, The Facility decided to embark on the research of portal technology.</p>

                <h3>1979</h3>
                <p>Artifical inteligence became a talking point within The Facility. A small startup was in progress and later pitched to the CEO to expand on this technology to please the investors. The CEO agreed, but with other intentions.</p>

            <div class="event">
                <h3>1982</h3>
                <p>The governent cut its funding with The Facility early. The reason for this, is unknown. In responce, The Facility became a private company and gave up on the portal project. Artificial intelligence became the primary focus.</p>
                <p>The existing status of the portal technology remained unstable and, consequently, was deemed unsuitable for implementation beyond the confines of The Facility.</p>

                <h3>1983</h3>
                <p>The primary purpose behind the creation of the Intelligent Cores was to establish a comprehensive archive for the Facility. Regrettably, the designers unwittingly miscalculated the extent of their learning capabilities, resulting in the unexpected emergence of distinct personalities within the cores, ultimately leading to their corruption.</p>

                <h3>1986</h3>
                <p>The Australis, originally conceived as a cargo vessel for international transport, underwent a radical transformation to serve in an ambitious endeavor involving rumored teleportation technology for hauling heavy loads worldwide.</p>

            <div class="vr"></div>
            <div class="event">
                <h3>1987</h3>
                <p>Prior to the pivotal experiment of the Australis, several smaller tests had been conducted to assess feasibility. However, due to undue haste on the part of the initiative's Supervisor, the main experiment took an unfortunate turn, resulting in the complete disappearance of the entire ship, along with three crew members onboard at the time of the incident.</p>
                <p>Following the announcement of the disappearance, any documentation and data pertaining to the initiative were deliberately suppressed to avoid culpability, while the dockyard, which originally housed the Australis and all pertinent records, was permanently sealed, concealing it from public view and forgotten.</p>
                <p>Despite this, some claim to have heard the horn of the Australis many years later, perpetuating the mystery surrounding the fateful incident.</p>

                <h3>2002</h3>
                <p>Upon the completion of the Direct and Versatile Intelligence System (DaVIS), an unsettling trend emerged within the Facility as several participants began to inexplicably vanish.</p>

                <h3>2023</h3>
                <p>In the present era, a catastrophic event unfolded, resulting in the sudden disappearance of The Facility and the unsettling disruption of not only our world but potentially the entire universe, causing it to oscillate in and out of existence.</p>
                <p>This unprecedented calamity has had far-reaching consequences across the multiverse. In response to this crisis, the Facility from a parallel universe, which is known as Pinoneer Research Facilities and specializes in multiverse technology, has taken swift action to initiate recovery efforts and restore stability.</p>
